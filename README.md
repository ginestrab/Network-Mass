# Network-Mass
MATLAB code to calculate the Network Mass



This repository contains:


1. mass_ER_github.m    
This is a MATLAB code calculate the mass of a Erdos-Renyi network. This code uses the mass.m MATLAB function.

2. mass_BB.github.m
 This is a MATLAB code to calculate the mass of the Bianconi-Barabasi model at different inverse temperatures. This code uses the mass.m MATLAB function and the NGF_d1.m function to generate the model (tree). 
   
3.mass_pierre_augier_github.m
This is a MATLAB code to calculate the mass of weighted and unweighted pierre augier collaboration network. This code uses the mass.m MATLAB function and the NGF_d1.m data coming from Manlio De Domenico Data Repository.
